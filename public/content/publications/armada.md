To support scalable edge computing applications, this paper proposes a new model using a dense network of "volunteer" edge nodes for elastic computation offloading. The core of this work is a distributed edge selection strategy that gives each client a unique view of available nodes to optimize for the lowest end-to-end latency. This is achieved through performance probing, dynamic load balancing, and proactive connections to multiple edge nodes, accounting for system heterogeneity and resource contention. Evaluations show this approach enables applications like AR-based cognitive assistance to deliver low-latency responses to a large number of distributed users.
