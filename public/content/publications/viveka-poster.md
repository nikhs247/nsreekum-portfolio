To address the challenge of frequent recharging for smart wearables, which is worsened by advanced sensors and on-device AI, this poster proposes Viveka. Viveka is an activity-aware adaptive strategy that intelligently selects sensors and adjusts their data sampling rates. Based on real-world trace simulations, this approach reduces sensing energy consumption by an average of 5X compared to continuous sampling, while preserving task accuracy.
