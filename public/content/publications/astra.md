To address performance issues in Mobile Augmented Reality, the paper proposes ASTRA, a smart prefetching framework for edge caches. ASTRA uses user interaction patterns and physical proximity to prefetch AR objects, improving cache hit rates by up to 35% and reducing latency by up to 14% compared to existing methods.
