To address slow convergence in Federated Learning caused by device and data heterogeneity, this paper introduces HACCS, a Heterogeneity-Aware Clustered Client Selection system. Instead of focusing on individual devices, HACCS clusters clients based on their statistical data distributions and ensures these clusters are represented during training. This approach, which uses privacy-preserving methods for clustering, is robust to device dropouts and reduces the time to convergence by 18%â€“38% compared to state-of-the-art methods, without compromising accuracy.
