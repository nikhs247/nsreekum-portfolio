To address the challenge of scaling edge applications in wide-area environments, this paper introduces Armada, a densely-distributed edge cloud infrastructure. Armada uniquely leverages a combination of both dedicated and volunteer resources to serve geo-distributed users effectively. It incorporates key optimization techniques such as performance-aware edge selection, auto-scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance. Evaluations demonstrate that Armada can easily deploy demanding applications like real-time object detection and face recognition, providing low-latency performance to users at a large scale.
