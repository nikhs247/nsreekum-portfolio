To address performance issues in Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR), this paper presents SPAARC, an AR-aware prefetching policy for edge caches. Traditional edge caching is inefficient for AR, so SPAARC intelligently prefetches virtual objects by considering their association with other objects and the user's physical proximity to them. It also employs a lazy fetching strategy and an adaptive tuning algorithm to optimize resource use and maximize Quality of Experience. Evaluations show SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates, with gains ranging from 3% to 40% over standard algorithms, ensuring timely availability of virtual objects.
