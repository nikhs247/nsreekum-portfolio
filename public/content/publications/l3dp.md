To address the challenge of placing data on edge servers for low-latency access, this paper compares three different data placement strategies. Using a unified framework, it evaluates distance-based, latency-based, and spatial-awareness-based approaches under similar constraints. Simulation experiments showed that the spatial-awareness-based strategy provides a quality of service on par with the latency-based strategy. Ultimately, both the spatial-awareness and latency-based methods proved to be better than the simpler distance-based strategy.
