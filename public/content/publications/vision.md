This paper tackles the challenge of storing the massive amount of data generated in edge environments. The authors first analyze the data requirements of emerging edge applications and then evaluate the suitability of an existing cloud storage system, Cassandra, for edge deployment. They conclude that while cloud systems can be adapted, they cannot fully support key edge requirements like user mobility and node fluctuation. Based on these findings, the paper proposes a set of fundamental design principles for creating a new, purpose-built edge-native storage system.
